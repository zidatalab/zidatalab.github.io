The dashboard is based on a [Methods] desribed in public first here in this [post](https://www.zidatasciencelab.de/reports/Methodenbeschreibung_Projektion_COVID-19/)


We created the dashboard using ***R Shiny*** with heavy usage of `tidyverse`, `gglot` and `shinydashboard`. For the estimation of the Reproduction Number R of COVID-19 cases we used the package `EpiEstim`.

The Dashboard is used since then by severals KVen to prepare for upcoming trends.

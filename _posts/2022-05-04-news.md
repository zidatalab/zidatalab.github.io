We have been rather busy ramping up out infrastructure and services. Our tech stack is now documented 
in a seperate [projects page](projects/infrastructure). 

Currently our team is focussing on 3 main projects in addition to our usual Health Care Research Projects:

1. [kvappradar.de](projects/kvappradar)
2. [SmED Analytics and Reporting](projects/ehrml)
3. [Machine Learning with EHR](projects/ehrml)

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` R
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![GGPLOT Output](/assets/posts/2020-05-19-testpost_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Test Mathjax

$$f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz$$

## Notes on Workflow from R Markdown to Post

0. Name your .Rmd according to your post name here : `2020-05-19-testpost.md`
1. knit your .Rmd to rmarkdown::github_document 
2. Upload the resulting 2020-05-19-testpost.md and its files into github. The md goes into *_posts* the files folder goes into *assets/posts/*.
3. Change the yaml header of 2020-05-19-testpost.md according to our standards and change the paths in the .md into `newpath=/assets/posts/oldpath`.
4. Done

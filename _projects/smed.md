excerpt: "Structured Initial Medical Assessment in Germany (SmED)"

SmED stands for "Structured Initial Medical Assessment in Germany". It is an initial assessment software that can support the user in assessing a patient's complaints. Through targeted and structured questions, the software is able to determine a recommendation regarding the urgency of treatment and the appropriate place of treatment. This recommendation supports the user in deciding which is the most appropriate care option for the patient.
SmED deliberately does not make a diagnosis. This is still reserved for a medical examination.

Our Team provides Technical and Analytical Support for this Project. An overview of SmED in Germany is provided via a [dashboard](https://smed.ziapp.de).

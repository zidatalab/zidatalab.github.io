### Projections

We are projecting COVID-19 in Germany since Mid March 2020. Results may be obtained from our [Corona-Dashboard](https://www.zidatasciencelab.de/covid19dashboard/Start").

### Dashboards

We created Dashboards with assessments of the current state of COVID-19 in Germany:

**Public Dashboard**

- *Simulation der COVID-19 Impfkampagne* This dashboard is written in `Angular` and has a `R` backend vor Data Wrangling and Input creation. It provides a topical overview of the next weeks regarding [COVID-19 Vaccination in Germany](https://www.zidatasciencelab.de/cov19vaccsim/), Methods are [here](https://www.zidatasciencelab.de/cov19vaccsim/Methoden).
- *Zi-Frühindikatoren* This dashboard is written in `R` and based on `flexdashboard` (only javascript) and hosted on github pages. [See it in action](https://www.zidatasciencelab.de/covid19dashboard/Start").

**Private Dashboard**
